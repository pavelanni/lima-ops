# For Kubernetes, you'll likely want to use a k8s template or configure cloud-init
# to install k3s, k8s, etc. We'll use a placeholder for now.
# You might want to copy a custom cloud-init.yaml for each VM here.
# For simplicity, we'll assume a basic template://k8s or similar
# or you'll handle k8s installation with subsequent Ansible tasks.

# Example of a basic `template://k8s` config if you want to embed it
# This assumes Lima supports embedding templates like this for additional config
# If not, you'd use `template://k8s` in `limactl start` and handle other setup
# with separate Ansible tasks.

# This section is highly dependent on how you want Lima to assist with k8s
# initial setup vs. doing it all with Ansible post-provisioning.
# A common approach is to let Lima create the VM, and then Ansible does the k8s install.

# Cloud-init configuration (example - you'll heavily customize this)
# This is where you might prepare the VM for Kubernetes.
# You can also use Ansible's `copy` and `shell` modules for this post-creation.
# cloud-init:
#   # An example for basic SSH setup, you might not need this if Lima handles it
#   # users:
#   #   - name: lima
#   #     ssh_authorized_keys:
#   #       - "ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC..." # Your SSH public key

#   # Example of installing some packages with cloud-init
#   # packages:
#   #   - curl
#   #   - vim
#
#   # Example of running commands on first boot
#   # runcmd:
#   #   - echo "Hello from cloud-init on {{ vm.name }}" >> /var/log/cloud-init-output.log
